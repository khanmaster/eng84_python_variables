# Testing the env with hello world message
print("hello world")

print("shahrukh")

# variables?

course_name = "devops 84" # string
Student_name = "Arun" # string
age = 16 # Integer
hourly_wage = 8.5 # float


print(course_name)
print(hourly_wage)
print(age)

# To get user data we use input()
first_name = input("Please enter you name ")
age = input(" Please enter you age ")
print("Hello ")
print(first_name)

# To check the type of data type()
print(type(age))


# overwriting a variable?

first_name = "variable value overwritten"
print(first_name)
```
